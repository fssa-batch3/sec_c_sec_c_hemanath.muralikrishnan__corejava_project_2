# Agrokart Backend Core Java Project

## Problem Statement

Agriculture is the backbone of India. We all know how the farmers are facing many issues at this time. I am going to create a web application to help farmers. The major problem faced by farmers was that they couldnâ€™t get fair prices for their vegetables and fruits. And also, they are facing transportation problems while getting cultivated vegetables and selling them in the market. They need four-wheeler vehicles to bring the produced vegetables to the wholesale market or daily market. If the cultivated crops are in massive amounts.

## Solution

I will develop a website where the farmer can sell their products, and end customers can buy the products and get to their doorstep. If some other organizations want, they can also buy.

## About this repo:

This repository contains the backend code for the Agrokart web application. The frontend development is handled separately in the following repository: [Link to Frontend Repository](https://github.com/fssa-batch3/hemanath.muralikrishnan__web_project/tree/dev).

The backend is developed using Core Java and integrated with an SQL database for data storage .

### Project Structure

The core components of the backend are organized as follows:

- [src/main/java/com/fssa/agrokart/model](src/main/java/com/fssa/agrokart/model): This directory contains the model classes that represents the objects.

- [src/main/java/com/fssa/agrokart/service](src/main/java/com/fssa/agrokart/service) : This directory contains service classes that implement business logic for the Agrokart web application.

- [src/main/java/com/fssa/agrokart/dao](src/main/java/com/fssa/agrokart/dao): The Data Access Object (DAO) classes are stored in this directory. The DAO classes handle interactions with the database and provide methods for CRUD operations.

- [src/test/java/com/fssa/agrokart](src/test/java/com/fssa/agrokart) : This directory contains unit test cases for the Agrokart backend.

## Milestone -1 

In Milestone-1, we will focus on implementing the backend logic and functionalities to support the Product CRUD operations.

### Key Tasks

1. [X] **Product Model**: Design a Product model to represent the properties of a product, such as name, description, price, quantity, and any other relevant attributes.

2. [X] **Create Product**: Implement a function that allows adding products to the platform. Users can provide product details, and the backend will store the product information in the database.

3. [X] **Read Products**: Implement a function to retrieve a list of all available products.

4. [X] **Read Products by Name**: Implement a function to filter products by name and retrieve a list of products matching the provided name.

5. [X] **Update Product**: Implement a function that enables updating the details of products. Users can modify product information such as name, description, price, quantities and any other relevant attributes.

6. [X] **Delete Product**: Implement a function that allows removing a product from the platform.

7. [X] **Validation and Error Handling**: Implement validation checks on input data to ensure that only valid and complete product information is accepted. Handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate error responses when necessary.

8. [X] **Unit Testing**: Write comprehensive unit tests using JUnit to ensure the correctness and robustness of the Product CRUD operations. Test-edge cases and error scenarios to verify that the backend functions as expected.
